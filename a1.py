# We iterate through the row array, examining pairs of adjacent seats.
# For each seat i, we calculate the ID of the personâ€™s partner (using XOR with 1).
# If the partner is not already seated next to them, we find the partner's current position, swap them with the person next to the original seat, and update the seat indices.
# Count the number of swaps required to make all couples sit together.

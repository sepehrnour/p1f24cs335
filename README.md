**Description:**
This project provides implementations for two algorithms:

    Algorithm 1: Connecting Pairs of Persons using the Union-Find data structure with unique variable names.
    
    Algorithm 2: Greedy Approach to the Hamiltonian Problem using an alternative greedy strategy.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.x installed on your machine.

**How to Run the Algorithms:**

    1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
    2. Navigate to the directory containing algorithm1.py.
    3. Run the command:
    4. python3 algorithm1.py or python3 algorithm2.py

_**Algorithm 1: Connecting Pairs of Persons**_

Input: Provide a space-separated list of people IDs representing their seat arrangement.

Output: The minimum number of swaps needed for couples to sit together.

_**Algorithm 2: Greedy Approach to Hamiltonian Problem**_

Input: Provide city distances, fuel available at each city, and the car's fuel efficiency (MPG).

Output: The index of the preferred starting city.

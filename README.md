# **CPSC 335 - Algorithm Engineering Project 1**

## **Group Members:**
- Joshua Lopez
- Sepehr Nourbakhsh
- Lynae Mercado

## **Description**
This project provides implementations for two algorithms:
1. **Algorithm 1:** Connecting Pairs of Persons using the Union-Find data structure with unique variable names.
2. **Algorithm 2:** Greedy Approach to the Hamiltonian Problem using an alternative greedy strategy.

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## **How to Run the Algorithms**

### **1. Algorithm 1: Connecting Pairs of Persons**
- Open a terminal/command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing `algorithm1.py`.
- Run the command:
  ```bash
  python3 algorithm1.py
- Input: Provide a space-separated list of people IDs representing their seat arrangement.
- Output: The minimum number of swaps needed for couples to sit together.

### **2. Algorithm 2: Greedy Approach to Hamiltonian Problem**
- Open a terminal/command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing algorithm2.py.
- Run the command:
  ```bash
  python3 algorithm2.py
- Input: Provide city distances, fuel available at each city, and the car's fuel efficiency (MPG).
- Output: The index of the preferred starting city.
